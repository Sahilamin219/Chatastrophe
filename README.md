 > ### How to use this app ?
 
 New users functionality is <strong>available</strong> now . You can also login into the app from either of the following users 

     username : sahil@gmail.com
     password : 123456
    
            OR
 
     username : sahilamin219@gmail.com 
     password : *****


 > ### Folder Structure

After creation, your project should look like this:

    my-app/
      README.md
      node_modules/
      package.json
      public/
        index.html
        favicon.ico
      src/
        App.css
        App.js
        index.css
        index.js
        logo.svg

For the project to build, these files must exist with exact filenames:

    public/index.html is the page template;
    src/index.js is the JavaScript entry point.

You can delete or rename the other files.

You may create subdirectories inside src. For faster rebuilds, only files inside src are processed by Webpack.
You need to put any JS and CSS files inside src, otherwise Webpack won’t see them.

Only files inside public can be used from public/index.html.
Read instructions below for using assets from JavaScript and HTML.

You can, however, create more top-level directories.
They will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.

# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.
npm run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.
npm run eject

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

I have fixed that issues for react js firebase building app for production

           1.) firebase init
           2.) What do you want to use as your public directory? build
           3.) Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? Yes
           4.) npm run build
           5.) firebase serve
           6.) firebase deploy
           
finish..
